U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 20,000 in February, the Labor Department said Friday, marking the slowest pace for job growth since September 2017—when hurricanes skewed hiring patterns—and falling well below economists’ expectations for 180,000 new jobs.                Some of February’s weak job growth might have been a response to strong hiring in previous months. Payrolls grew 311,000 in January and 227,000 in December. The three-month average for job gains clocked in at 186,000, near the average for much of the expansion.      The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8% in February from 4% the month before, returning to a level last seen in October. Wages grew at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.

       "      <td>The breakneck pace of hiring slumped in February, a sign that U.S. growth is cooling, though strong wage growth and earlier robust job gains suggest the economy’s near decadelong expansion will endure. U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 20,000 in February, the Labor Department said Friday, marking the slowest pace for job growth since September 2017—when hurricanes skewed hiring patterns—and falling well below economists’ expectations for 180,000 new jobs.                Some of February’s weak job growth might have been a response to strong hiring in previous months. Payrolls grew 311,000 in January and 227,000 in December. The three-month average for job gains clocked in at 186,000, near the average for much of the expansion.      The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8% in February from 4% the month before, returning to a level last seen in October. Wages grew at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.          For months, strong U.S. job growth has been a counterpoint to other economic disturbances, including a partial federal-government shutdown in late December and January, a sputtering U.S. housing sector and a global economic slowdown.     “The labor market has ...</td>\n",

       "0  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report Friday detailing a recent COVID-19 outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, which was cited by the agency as a contributing factor to its recent change in mask guidance.Over the July 4 weekend, gatherings in Provincetown contributed to at least 900 cases, and roughly 75% of those who tested positive in the cluster were vaccinated. The Provincetown report concludes that spread among highly-vaccinated populations does occur and suggests that authorities reimplement mask mandates and other mitigation measures, even for the vaccinated. The Provincetown report was a major warning sign for CDC officials, who earlier this week reversed course and once again recommended that vaccinated Americans wear face coverings in some indoor settings. A leaked internal document from the CDC included preliminary data from the Provincetown outbreak in its summary of information on breakthrough cases of the delta variant. The vaccines are working. Of the 900 cases related to the Provincetown cluster, there have been no deaths, 7 hospitalizations, and the symptoms are largely mild. Our positivity peaked at 15% on 7/15 and was only ...   \n",

A 4-4 order let stand a state Supreme Court decision allowing officials to count mail-in ballots received up to three days after Election Day.

       "3  Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo A new pair of nationwide polls paint divergent pictures of the 2020 White House race — with former Vice President Joe Biden ahead by double digits in one survey and President Donald Trump significantly narrowing the presumptive Democratic nominee’s lead in the other. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday morning reports that more than half of registered voters, 53 percent, prefer Biden, while 41 percent favor Trump.\\nThat 12-point advantage, however, comes hours after a CNN poll published Sunday evening showed Biden’s lead tightening to only 4 points, as Trump surged to within striking distance of his likely general election opponent. Fifty percent of registered voters in that CNN survey preferred the Democratic ticket, Biden and presumptive vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and 46 percent supported the Republican incumbents, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\\nIn the previous version of the CNN poll, released in June, Biden led Trump among registered voters by 14 points, 55-41.\\nResponding to Biden’s diminished edge over Trump, Democratic National Committee communications dir...   \n",

Drew Angerer/Getty Images                  Updated at 5:22 p.m ET  Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh opened on a contentious note Tuesday, with Senate Democrats raising noisy objections that much of Kavanaugh's lengthy paper trail is still off limits.  The hearing proceeded despite Democrats' call for delay. Republicans, who control the Senate, hope to confirm Kavanaugh in time to join the high court when its fall term begins next month, cementing a 5-4 conservative majority.      At 53, Kavanaugh would be the second-youngest member of the court and the second appointed by President Trump.  Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the...   \n",

       "0  the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) released a report friday detailing a recent covid-19 outbreak in provincetown, massachusetts, which was cited by the agency as a contributing factor to its recent change in mask guidance.over the july 4 weekend, gatherings in provincetown contributed to at least 900 cases, and roughly 75% of those who tested positive in the cluster were vaccinated. the provincetown report concludes that spread among highly-vaccinated populations does occur and suggests that authorities reimplement mask mandates and other mitigation measures, even for the vaccinated. the provincetown report was a major warning sign for cdc officials, who earlier this week reversed course and once again recommended that vaccinated americans wear face coverings in some indoor settings. a leaked internal document from the cdc included preliminary data from the provincetown outbreak in its summary of information on breakthrough cases of the delta variant. the vaccines are working. of the 900 cases related to the provincetown cluster, there have been no deaths, 7 hospitalizations, and the symptoms are largely mild. our positivity peaked at 15% and was only 4.8% yes...   \n",
       "1  the attorney for the former port authority official at the center of the george washington bridge scandal said there is evidence showing that new jersey gov. chris christie was aware of the lane closures when they happened. alan l. zegas, who is representing david wildstein, the official who ordered the lane closures and resigned as a result last year, said in a letter to the legal counsel for the port authority that there is evidence “tying mr. christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated publicly.” “mr. wildstein contests the accuracy of various statements that the governor made about him and he can prove the inaccuracy of some,” said the attorney, alan l. zegas. the new allegations surfaced as part of an ongoing spat over whether the port authority should cover the legal expenses of mr. wildstein, and raise new questions about what mr. christie knew about the mid-september lane closures on the george washington bridge. emails seemed to indicate the traffic jams were orchestrated by members of mr. christie’s inner circle and his allies at the port authority, including mr. wildstein, and w...   \n",
       "2  some suits seek to delay state officials from certifying final results, a rare step that judges likely would be reluctant to take without proof of irregularities significant enough to change the election outcome, according to legal analysts. judges have rejected several trump campaign and allied claims. here is a state-by-state guide to the lawsuits: pennsylvania republican party of pennsylvania v. boockvar (link) filed: july 10 a lawsuit filed by pennsylvania republicans in july reached the u.s. supreme court in recent weeks. a 4-4 order let stand a state supreme court decision allowing officials to count mail-in ballots received up to three days after election day. the court refused republicans’ second request to hear the case before election day, but left open the possibility for postelection litigation. justice samuel alito, who backed the pennsylvania republicans’ position and voted to overturn the pennsylvania supreme court decision, suggested in a statement accompanying the order that considering those mail-in votes valid would allow state courts to undercut election rules set by the state’s gop-controlled legislature. pennsylvania secretary of state kathy boockvar direc...   \n",

    "### Conclusion: Sentiment Analysis by Political Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The violin plot above illustrates the distribution of normalized sentiment scores across different political leanings — **Left**, **Center**, and **Right**. All three groups display a negative average sentiment, with the majority of scores clustering between **-0.5 and -0.7**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Sentiment Scores:\n",
    "- **Center**: -0.605  \n",
    "- **Left**: -0.597  \n",
    "- **Right**: -0.601  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "- **Overall negativity**: Articles across all political biases tend to carry a predominantly negative tone.\n",
    "- **Slight variation**: The **Left-leaning** articles exhibit marginally less negativity on average compared to Center and Right, though the differences are not large enough to indicate any stark contrast.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: The sentiment spread and central tendency are relatively uniform, suggesting that emotional framing in political content may be a generalized trait rather than highly polarized across biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that while political bias influences emotional tone (as seen in emotion classification), sentiment — especially negativity — is consistently present across the spectrum.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Post-Processing**:  \n",
    "  The results were grouped by **political leaning**, and I counted the number of articles labeled as sensationalistic versus not.  \n",

       "6910   By Michael Holden and Stephen AddisonLONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Investigators believe that the masked killer known as \"Jihadi John,\" who fronted Islamic State beheading videos, is a British man named Mohammed Emwazi, two U.S. government sources said on Thursday.In videos released by Islamic State (IS), the black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have decapitated hostages including Americans, Britons and Syrians.He was born in Kuwait and comes from a prosperous family in London, where he grew up and graduated with a computer programming degree.Emwazi, who used the videos to threaten the West and taunt leaders such as President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron, was believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined IS.In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the bridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.Hostages gave him the name John as he and other IS Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles. Another was dubbed George.Two U.S. government sources told Reuters that John was believed by investigators to be Emwazi, a fluen...   \n",

    "### Conclusion: Sensationalism by Political Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right-leaning articles are almost **4.5×** more likely to be sensationalistic than center-leaning ones**—with **18.9%** of right-leaning content labeled sensationalist versus just **4.25%** for center-leaning. This dramatic gap suggests that sensationalism is a key differentiator in how ideological perspectives engage and influence their audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of sensationalism across political leanings reveals notable differences in the proportion of sensationalistic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proportion of Sensationalist Articles:\n",
    "- **Center**: 4.25%\n",
    "- **Left**: 7.95%\n",
    "- **Right**: 18.88%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "- **Right-leaning articles** show a significantly higher proportion of sensationalistic content compared to Center and Left. Nearly **1 in 5** articles from right-leaning sources were labeled sensationalist.\n",
    "- **Center-leaning articles** have the **lowest incidence**, with over **95%** of content classified as non-sensational.\n",
    "- **Left-leaning articles** fall in between, showing a moderate level of sensationalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that the degree of sensationalism in political reporting may correlate with ideological leaning, with **right-leaning media more likely to employ sensationalistic language or framing**.\n",

    "To cross-validate emotional tone classifications and compare with earlier model-based results, I performed another round of **emotion classification** using **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Size and Token Limit**:  \n",
    "  A **10% sample** of articles was selected, with each input capped at **1024 tokens** to ensure compatibility with the model and maintain cost-efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompting Strategy**:  \n",
    "  I used a carefully crafted prompt to extract scores for the same six emotions as before:  \n",
    "  **sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise**, ensuring direct comparability with the `distilbert-base-uncased-emotion` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Parameters**:  \n",
    "  The **temperature was set to 0.0** to maintain deterministic outputs and ensure consistent scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post-Processing**:  \n",
    "  Emotion scores were extracted from the model responses for each text.  \n",
    "  These were then **grouped by political leaning**, and the **mean score for each emotion** was calculated to observe patterns across ideological categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "The emotion classification results show consistent patterns across political leanings, with subtle yet meaningful differences in emotional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "- **Anger and Sadness** are highest in **right-leaning** articles, continuing the trend seen in model-based classification.\n",
    "- **Fear** is slightly more dominant in **center-leaning** articles.\n",
    "- **Joy and Love** scores remain low across the board, but are marginally higher in center and left-leaning texts.\n",
    "- **Surprise** levels are fairly balanced, with a slight edge in **left-leaning** content.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that **negative emotions (anger, fear, sadness)** dominate across all political segments, but are most pronounced in **right-leaning** content. This emotional landscape mirrors the sentiment and sensationalism findings, reinforcing the emotional framing tendencies across the political spectrum.\n"

    "- **GPT-3.5 Turbo** scores **negative emotions (fear, sadness, anger)** much higher, indicating it interprets content as more emotionally charged.\n",
    "- **Joy** and **Love** are consistently low in both models, but **GPT assigns even lower joy**, especially to **right-leaning** content.\n",
    "- **Surprise** sees a drastic divergence: GPT scores it significantly higher across all groups, while DistilBERT barely detects it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretability Implications:\n",
    "- The **GPT-based approach** may capture **contextual emotional nuance** better due to its generative nature and broader world knowledge.\n",
    "- The **DistilBERT-based method** is more **statistical and token-sensitive**, resulting in lower, flatter emotion scores.\n",

(related: previously redacted email between peter daszak, anthony fauci suddenly sees light of day) but the high titers is what’s causing concern that even vaccinated can transmit delta, even if they don’t become noticeably ill because the vaccine is protecting them. also need to factor in that vaccinated adults may be less cautious, so more likely to come in contact with virus — scott gottlieb, md (@scottgottliebmd) the report suggests that the viral load carried by vaccinated individuals may be similar to that of unvaccinated individuals, but that does not necessarily mean they are just as contagious or will suffer the same severity of symptoms, according to former food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb. officials examined data from provincetown between july 3 and july 17. despite issuing the new mask guidance on tuesday the agency did not release the provincetown report until friday. the public had no access to key data driving the masking decision until an internal cdc presentation was leaked to the washington post late on the night of july 29. “this outbreak investigation is one of many cdc has been involved in across the country and data from those investigations will be rapidly shared with the public when available. the agency works every day to use the best available science and data to quickly and transparently inform the american public about threats to health,” walensky added friday.\n",

      " The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published a report highlighting a COVID-19 outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, which played a significant role in the agency's decision to update its mask guidance. The outbreak, stemming from gatherings over the July 4 weekend, led to around 900 cases, with approximately 75% of those infected being vaccinated individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "This incident underscored the reality that transmission can occur even among highly vaccinated populations, prompting a call for reinstating mask mandates and other protective measures, irrespective of vaccination status. The Provincetown report served as a critical wakeup call for CDC officials, who swiftly responded by recommending that vaccinated individuals wear masks in certain indoor settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "CDC Director Rochelle Walensky emphasized the importance of the findings from Massachusetts, pointing to the concerning levels of viral load associated with the Delta variant and the potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit the virus. While the outbreak in Provincetown raised valid concerns about breakthrough cases, it is crucial to recognize that the vaccines have proven highly effective in preventing severe illness and fatalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the outbreak's reach among vaccinated individuals, the data unequivocally demonstrates the vaccines' ability to avert serious health complications. Out of the 900 cases linked to the cluster, only seven required hospitalization, and there have been zero reported deaths nearly a month following the initial outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb highlighted that although vaccinated individuals may carry a similar viral load as unvaccinated counterparts, it does not necessarily equate to equal contagiousness or severity of symptoms. The report from Provincetown, analyzed between July 3 and July 17, affirmed the CDC's decision to update its mask guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the delayed release of the Provincetown report to the public has raised transparency concerns, with critical data only becoming available after a leaked internal CDC presentation was disclosed to the media. Moving forward, it is imperative for the CDC to prioritize prompt and transparent communication to effectively address public health threats, as emphasized by Director Walensky.\n",

      " On the same day the giant Christmas tree was scheduled to be lit outside the NBC studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City, the network took significant action by parting ways with one of its prominent figures. Matt Lauer was dismissed on Wednesday after a courageous individual came forward about his alleged misconduct. This revelation of inappropriate sexual behavior by Lauer, the long-time \"Today Show\" host, triggered a swift response from NBC management.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alleged incident reportedly occurred at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, and the victim described further inappropriate behavior from Lauer that persisted in the workplace after the games. NBC News took swift action following a detailed complaint, leading to Lauer's prompt removal. The victim's attorney, Ari Wilkenfeld, commended NBC's response but urged further efforts to support the victim and any other women who may share similar experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficult task of announcing Lauer's departure fell upon his co-anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, who described the news as saddening and emphasized NBC's commitment to upholding workplace standards. The announcement highlighted the importance of creating a safe and respectful environment for all employees, demonstrating a zero-tolerance approach towards misconduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of Lauer's dismissal, NBC swiftly removed his presence from their social media platforms, redirecting focus onto the remaining hosts. Guthrie and Kotb, visibly affected by the news, communicated their shock and expressed solidarity with the victim and any others who may come forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guthrie and Kotb affirmed NBC's pledge to cover the story with journalistic integrity, promising further updates as more information unfolds. The public condemnation of Lauer's actions was not limited to his colleagues; even President Trump weighed in on the incident as the news spread.\n",

      "The termination of Lauer's contract, amid a wave of allegations across various media platforms, including Disney, NPR, and Fox News, marks a shift towards accountability in the industry. This move follows the recent dismissal of another prominent TV host, Charlie Rose, signaling a growing intolerance for inappropriate behavior.\n",

    "- **Left Article Sentiment Score**: -0.557  \n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.922\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "- **Right Article Sentiment Score**: -0.624  \n",
    "- **Left Article Sentiment Score**: -0.552  \n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.864\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "- **Sentiment Scores**: In both examples, the **right-leaning articles** display slightly more **negative sentiment** compared to the **left-leaning** versions. This is consistent with previous findings that media narratives often adopt a more emotional or negative tone.\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: The **cosine similarity** scores indicate a high degree of **semantic similarity** between the original and generated articles. The values (ranging from **0.864 to 0.922**) suggest that, despite stylistic and ideological shifts, the generated left-leaning articles maintain a strong alignment with the factual content of the original right-leaning articles.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Topic Dependence:\n",
    "- The **sentiment difference** between right- and left-leaning articles varies depending on the topic. For some topics, right-leaning articles may exhibit more **positive sentiment**, while for others, they may lean more negative. This variability highlights the **context-dependent nature** of sentiment in political discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that while ideological reframing through **GPT-3.5 Turbo** can successfully alter the **tone** of an article, the **underlying sentiment** can shift differently depending on the subject matter. The high **semantic similarity** indicates that the model preserves the core information even when reinterpreting the narrative.\n"

    "# Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyses of **emotion**, **sentiment**, and **sensationalism** across different political leanings reveal consistent patterns, with subtle nuances depending on the specific topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment**: Right-leaning articles often exhibit **more negative sentiment**, though this can vary depending on the topic.\n",
    "- **Emotion**: Negative emotions like **anger** and **sadness** are more pronounced in **right-leaning** content, while **fear** is more prominent in **center-leaning** articles.\n",
    "- **Sensationalism**: **Right-leaning** articles were found to be more sensationalistic, while **center-leaning** articles showed the least sensationalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of **GPT-3.5 Turbo** for generating left-leaning articles from right-leaning ones demonstrated **high semantic similarity** (0.86–0.92), but subtle changes in **sentiment** were observed. This suggests that ideological shifts can be achieved without significant loss of factual content, though the **emotional tone** is influenced by the model’s framing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for Improvement:\n",
    "1. **Broaden the sample**: Increase the dataset size for a more robust sentiment and emotion analysis.\n",
    "2. **Topic-specific analysis**: Conduct topic-based analyses to understand how sentiment and emotions differ for different issues.\n",
    "3. **Hybrid models**: Experiment with hybrid approaches combining both **GPT-based** and **DistilBERT-based** methods for emotion classification to balance accuracy and interpretability.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation metrics**: Explore additional metrics such as **perplexity** and **topic modeling** to better understand framing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These improvements could refine the insights and help achieve more accurate, nuanced conclusions.\n"

    "### Why GPT and DistilBERT Yielded These Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of sentiment, emotion, and sensationalism analyses can be attributed to how models like **GPT-3.5 Turbo** and **DistilBERT** are trained and how they process text. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-trained Biases**: Both models are pre-trained on vast corpora of text from the internet. Since much of the content they were trained on comes from diverse sources with varying political ideologies, they inevitably pick up on patterns and biases inherent in the language. For instance, **right-leaning content** tends to use more **strong, emotional language**, which the model associates with negative emotions and sensationalistic tones.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Language Patterns**: **DistilBERT** is a **transformer-based model** that excels at understanding context and sentiment. It tends to detect patterns that are common in the language used by different political factions. **Right-leaning articles** often include more dramatic phrasing and negative framing, which is why **DistilBERT** might identify them as more **negative** or **sensational** compared to the **center** or **left**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Design**: The **GPT-3.5 Turbo** model, known for generating coherent and human-like text, is designed to predict the next token based on preceding tokens. When tasked with generating content with a specific political leaning, the model essentially **reframes the tone** by amplifying or moderating the sentiment based on its training data. This can lead to subtle shifts in sentiment and emotion, depending on the ideological framing the model is instructed to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Emotion Detection**: Both models detect emotions based on the frequency and intensity of words or phrases that are typically associated with specific emotional categories. For example, **anger** and **sadness** are often more prominent in **right-leaning** content due to the **framing of issues** in a crisis-driven or conflict-oriented way, a common rhetorical technique in political discourse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the results reflect **how these models encode the societal language norms** and emotional cues they have been exposed to, rather than being purely objective analyses of the content.\n"
